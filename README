Facebook Graph API
==================

Currently this is an alpha version of an easy to use implementation of the FB 
Graph API.

It is currently working with CakePHP as a component, please see the source files 
in cake/components/

To use it with cake, just move the files in cake/components/ to 
$app_dir/controllers/components/ and include it like any other CakePHP component.

It is written to be fairly stand alone and it has it's own basic Http client in 
the http_request.php file. This means it will be easy to port to any other 
framework you may be using.

As a note of warning, the HTTP client currently assumes that all data is 
returned error-free. This is listed as a todo in the source.

API Conventions
===============

I would like to implement this as simply as possible, so I want it to follow 
conventions as much as possible.

In the Graph API each Facebook entity is represented as a node in the social 
graph, we will call these objects. Each object has a relationship to other
objects, these all called connection types or relationships.

Objects can be requested and introspection is possible too (i.e: you can ask FB 
what types of relationships it has to other objects. Since the protocol follows 
an oAuth REST model, we can interact with objects using HTTP verbs: GET, POST, 
and DELETE.

In keeping with this, all methods will be named with the following scheme:
	- verb_relationship(object_id)
Except when the relationship is self then you will be able to access the object:
	- verb_object(object_id)
