FB-Graph-API
============

Currently this is an alpha version of an easy to use implementation of the FB 
Graph API.

It is currently working with CakePHP as a component, please see the source files 
in cake/components/

To use it with cake, just move the files in cake/components/ to 
$app_dir/controllers/components/ and include it like any other CakePHP component.

It is written to be fairly stand alone and it has it's own basic Http client in 
the http_request.php file. This means it will be easy to port to any other 
framework you may be using.

As a note of warning, the HTTP client currently assumes that all data is 
returned error-free. This is listed as a todo in the source.
